About me


I'm a pre-final year student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India, with an expected year of Graduation 2021. I consider myself as practical people who are interested in analysing and solving real-world problems, rather than just aim to enhancing knowledge within the field.
